This repo contains files created by the Echo Team, for the Ada Software Engineering Internship Program Project week.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Echo team was given a [SQLite database file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nolanbconaway/whatcd-hiphop), and we were required to write queries that answer the following questions:
- What is the most popular release type?
- For the last three years, what release type has the most torrents?
- Who are the top five most common artists?
- What is the average number of downloads?
